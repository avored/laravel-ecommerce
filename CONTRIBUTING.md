# Contributing to AvoRed E commerce App

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests
The AvoRed team heavily uses (and loves!) GitHub for all of our software management. 
We use GitHub issues exclusively to track all bugs and features.

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/avored/laravel-ecommerce/issues) here on GitHub. 
If you can, **please provide a fix and create a pull request (PR) instead**; this will automatically create an issue for you.
* Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately - remember, AvoRed is open source and free of charge. 
* Occasionally we'll close issues. 
Please feel free to re-open issues we've closed if there's something we've missed and they still need to be addressed.

## Contributing Pull Requests
PR's are even better than issues. 
We gladly accept community pull requests. 
There are a few necessary steps before we can accept a pull request:

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/avored/laravel-ecommerce/issues) describing the problem that you are looking to solve in 
your PR (if one is not already open), and your approach to solving it (not necessary for bug fixes - only feature contributions).
